# Cherry üçí
Cherry is currently macOS only minimalistic command line pomodoro timer, utilising the curses module.
<br>
<br>
It aims to have as few distractions as possible, allowing you to get on with your work.
<br>
<br>
Your work time will be broken up into sessions of 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break in between these. <br>
On your fourth break, the break time will be extended to 30 minutes, in keeping with the traditional pomodoro technique üçÖ.
<br>
<br>
In future, Cherry may have variations on the traditional pomodoro technique, such as flow modes. The command list and this README will be updated accordingly.

## Dependencies
None, except for having macOS. <br>
macOS comes with curses installed, and while windows computers can download an external module to get access to curses, the sound alert feature would break. <br>

Windows support may come in future updates. <br>
